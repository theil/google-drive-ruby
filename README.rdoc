This is a Ruby library to read/write files/spreadsheets in Google Drive/Docs.

NOTE: This is NOT a library to create Google Drive App.


= Migration from ver. 0.x.x / 1.x.x to to ver. 2.x.x

There are some incompatible API changes. See {MIGRATING.md}[https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby/blob/master/MIGRATING.md].


= How to install

  $ sudo gem install google_drive


= How to use

First, follow Step 1 and 2 of "Authorizing requests with OAuth 2.0" in {this page}[https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/about-auth] to get a client ID and client secret for OAuth. Set "Application type" to "Other" in the form to create a client ID if you use GoogleDrive.saved_session method as in the example below.

Next, create a file config.json which contains the client ID and client secret you got above, which looks like:

  {
    "client_id": "xxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "client_secret": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  }

Example to read/write files in Google Drive:

  require "google_drive"

  # Creates a session. This will prompt the credential via command line for the
  # first time and save it to config.json file for later usages.
  session = GoogleDrive.saved_session("config.json")

  # Gets list of remote files.
  session.files.each do |file|
    p file.title
  end

  # Uploads a local file.
  session.upload_from_file("/path/to/hello.txt", "hello.txt", convert: false)

  # Downloads to a local file.
  file = session.file_by_title("hello.txt")
  file.download_to_file("/path/to/hello.txt")

  # Updates content of the remote file.
  file.update_from_file("/path/to/hello.txt")

Example to read/write spreadsheets:

  require "google_drive"

  # Creates a session. This will prompt the credential via command line for the
  # first time and save it to config.json file for later usages.
  session = GoogleDrive.saved_session("config.json")

  # First worksheet of
  # https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg
  # Or https://docs.google.com/a/someone.com/spreadsheets/d/pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg/edit?usp=drive_web
  ws = session.spreadsheet_by_key("pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg").worksheets[0]

  # Gets content of A2 cell.
  p ws[2, 1]  #==> "hoge"

  # Changes content of cells.
  # Changes are not sent to the server until you call ws.save().
  ws[2, 1] = "foo"
  ws[2, 2] = "bar"
  ws.save

  # Dumps all cells.
  (1..ws.num_rows).each do |row|
    (1..ws.num_cols).each do |col|
      p ws[row, col]
    end
  end

  # Yet another way to do so.
  p ws.rows  #==> [["fuga", ""], ["foo", "bar]]

  # Reloads the worksheet to get changes by other clients.
  ws.reload
